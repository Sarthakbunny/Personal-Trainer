## ✅ What’s Done So Far

### 🔧 **1. Project Structure & Setup**

You’ve planned and partially built a **modular backend** in Go for a fitness AI app:

```
/backend
├── cmd/api/main.go            ← app entrypoint
├── handlers/                  ← API endpoint logic
├── services/                  ← Firebase + Gemini logic
├── routes/                    ← API route registration
├── docs/                      ← Swagger docs (auto-generated)
├── firebase-service-account.json  ← Firebase Admin key (private)
├── .env                       ← Gemini API key
└── go.mod / go.sum            ← Go modules
```

### 📡 **2. API Server with Fiber (Go)**

* Using **Fiber** for routing (fast + expressive)
* `main.go` sets up:

  * Swagger docs at `/swagger/index.html`
  * Registers routes via a `routes` package

---

### 🔐 **3. Firebase Integration (Admin SDK)**

In `services/firebase.go`, you:

* Initialized Firebase App with Admin SDK
* Created global:

  * `FirebaseAuth` client (for verifying users)
  * `FirestoreClient` (for storing user data, plans, check-ins)

➡️ You’ll use this to:

* Authenticate requests via Firebase ID tokens
* Store onboarding, plans, and streaks

---

### 🤖 **4. Gemini API Integration**

In `services/gemini.go`, you:

* Built a generic Gemini API client using HTTP POST
* Created a function: `GenerateSuggestions(prompt string) string`
* Accepts a structured prompt and returns text (workout + diet plan)

➡️ Example prompt:

> "User wants to lose weight and follows a vegetarian diet. Give a moderate-intensity workout and diet plan for today."

---

### 📄 **5. First API: `/api/suggestions`**

In `handlers/suggestions.go`, you:

* Accept a POST request with user goals
* Build a Gemini prompt from that input
* Call Gemini API and return the suggestion to the frontend

---

### 📚 **6. Swagger Docs Integration**

* Using `swaggo/swag` + `fiber-swagger`

* Swagger annotations added to:

  * `main.go` (global docs)
  * `handlers/suggestions.go` (endpoint details)

* You now generate docs with:

  ```bash
  swag init --generalInfo cmd/api/main.go --output ./docs
  ```

* Swagger UI available at:
  `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html`

## 🧩 What’s Next / To Be Done

Here’s what remains to be built in backend:

| Feature                     | Description                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 Firebase Auth Middleware | Verify user token and attach UID to context       |
| 📝 Onboarding API           | Save user’s answers in Firestore                  |
| 📬 Suggestions API (GET)    | Fetch today's stored suggestion or trigger Gemini |
| ✅ Check-In API              | Save daily check-in to track streak               |
| 🔥 Streak API               | Calculate and return current streak               |
| 📄 Firestore Rules          | Basic read/write security (optional for MVP)      |
